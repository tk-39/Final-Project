The report saw some changes mainly in the First and Second chapters. 

This was due to the feedback I received in the first hand-in, whereby I was given a low score and told by my supervisor that it was lacking in a few areas. In hindsight, it was evident that the introduction and literature 
review were vague and ambiguous, especially the project aims. After having completed the implementation and having a discussion with my supervisor, I went back to these chapters and rewrote them entirely. An important note
however, is that the project's premise remained the same, but was clarified in the introduction to allow the reader to easily understand the purpose of the project. The literature review was changed to explain NST in more 
detail which the previous iteration of the literature review severely lacked. I also discussed other NST studies which the original hand-in did not. 

The rest of the project remained the same, but with a few cuts to prevent over-repeating myself throughout the project such as restating the project aims as was required for each hand-in. I also removed some text which seemed 
unecessary and out of line with the rest of the project.
