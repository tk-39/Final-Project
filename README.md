# Final-Project
Github repo for Computer Science Final Project

This is the repository for my Final Project, in which I will be uploading files along the course of the semester, in line with the development of my project.

Note -  The Gantt chart and Milestone table is not final and is subject to change as the semester progresses. Currently, it only contains the first sprint (project proposal) along with some tags for the upcoming submissions
