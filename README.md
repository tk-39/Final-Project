This is the repository for my Final Project, a research disseration on Neural style transfer


Abstract:

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an optimisation technique that utilises Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to render a content image in different styles to
create artistic imagery. The influential work of Gatys et al.  allowed for the
progression of the NST algorithm and has since become a trending topic in academic literature and industry. The algorithm progressed vastly since its inception and has even taken on the form of video and audio in recent discoveries of
NST. This thesis aims to provide additional research into the study of NST and
focuses on the ability to empower artists by using it as a tool in their artistic practice. First, a discussion of existing NST research and other generative art models
is presented. Next, the algorithm is tested extensively and is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Research is also carried out in the form of surveys and
interviews throughout the thesis and provides opinions on NST. Finally, a discussion of NST and its applications in future work is presented. Overall, artists can
benefit from using this tool in their work and can inspire new ideas in the world
of art
